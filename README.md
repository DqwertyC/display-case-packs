# Minecraft Display Cases

This datapack adds display cases to Minecraft!

Display cases function as solid-block alternatives to item frames.  
To craft one, combine a smooth stone slab, an item frame, and glass or stained glass in a smithing table:

Once placed, a display case can be interacted with by right clicking.  
If the display case is empty, right click with an item to place it in the case.  
If the display case has an item, right click with an empty hand to remove it, or with an item to swap it.  
Crouching disables interaction, allowing blocks to be placed on the display case (similar to blocks with GUIs).

Punching a display case will break it, dropping the case and the item that was in the case.  

Display cases can be made with regular glass or stained glass, and with regular item frames or glowing item frames.
